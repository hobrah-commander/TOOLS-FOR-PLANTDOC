# TOOLS-FOR-PLANTDOC
# TOOLS-FOR-PLANTDOC

This repository contains a collection of tools and utilities for working with the PlantDoc dataset. The tools in this repository can be used to load and preprocess the data, train and evaluate machine learning models on the data, and perform other tasks related to the PlantDoc dataset.

## Contents

- `data_utils.py`: A Python module containing functions for loading and preprocessing the PlantDoc dataset.
- `model_utils.py`: A Python module containing functions for training and evaluating machine learning models on the PlantDoc dataset.
- `visualization_utils.py`: A Python module containing functions for visualizing the PlantDoc data and model predictions.
- `examples`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks with examples of how to use the tools in this repository.

## Requirements

To use the tools in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 2.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations only)

## Usage

To use the tools in this repository, clone the repository and install the required packages. For example:

$ git clone https://github.com/plantdoc/tools-for-plantdoc
$ cd tools-for-plantdoc
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Once the required packages are installed, you can use the tools in this repository by importing them into your Python code. For example:

```python
# Import the data_utils module
from tools_for_plantdoc import data_utils

# Load the PlantDoc dataset
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = data_utils.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
X_train, y_train = data_utils.preprocess_data(X_train, y_train)
X_test, y_test = data_utils.preprocess_data(X_test, y_test)

You can also refer to the example notebooks in the examples directory for more detailed examples of how to use the tools in this repository.
